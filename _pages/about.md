Hello and welcome to my homepage! I’m Thien Quy Pham, a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Pittsburgh. My journey began in medical school in Vietnam, where I discovered a passion for research that led me to transfer to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics and developed a keen interest in applying quantitative methods to biomedical questions.

I’m now fortunate to be advised by Dr. George Tseng, focusing my research on Bayesian modeling, circadian biology, and multi-omics data integration. I find it exciting to uncover hidden temporal patterns in biological systems and contribute to our understanding of health and disease.

My collaborative work spans bioinformatics, multi-omics analysis, and infectious disease. I work with a wide range of datasets—from RNA-seq, single-cell, proteomics, and ATAC to clinical, panel, and longitudinal studies. When I’m not diving into data, I love singing and spending time with my cat :).

Feel free to explore my site for publications, my CV, teaching experience, and current research projects. Thank you for visiting!
