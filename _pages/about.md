Hello and welcome to my homepage! My name is Thien Quy Pham, and I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Pittsburgh. I came to America in 2017 after spending several years in medical school in Vietnam. Moving here helped me explore new academic directions and ultimately shift my focus to statistics :).

My advisor is George Tseng, and my research lies at the intersection of circadian biology, Bayesian modeling, and multi-omics data integration. I am passionate about developing statistical and machine learning methods to uncover temporal dynamics in biological systems and improve our understanding of health and disease.

This site showcases my publications, CV, teaching, and current projects. Thanks for visiting!
