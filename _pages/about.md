Hello and welcome to my homepage! My name is Thien Quy Pham, and I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Pittsburgh. I earned my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and prior to that, I spent several years in medical school in Vietnam. My journey across disciplines and continents has shaped my deep interest in statistical modeling and its applications in biomedical research.

I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. George Tseng, and my research lies at the intersection of circadian biology, Bayesian modeling, and multi-omics data integration. I am passionate about developing statistical and machine learning methods to uncover temporal patterns in biological systems and contribute to our understanding of health and disease.

Beyond circadian research, I have engaged in a wide range of collaborative projects spanning bioinformatics, multi-omics analysis, and infectious disease. Beyond my academic life, I enjoy singing and playing with my cat :). 

This site highlights my publications, CV, teaching experience, and current research projects. Thank you for visiting!
