Hello and welcome to my homepage! I’m Sarah Wang, a second-year PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Pittsburgh, where I have the privilege of working under the guidance of Dr. George C. Tseng. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Statistics and Economics from the University of Toronto, and later, I pursued a Master’s in Biostatistics at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. It was during my time at Columbia that I developed a deep passion for Biostatistics and its potential to address complex health challenges.

My research interests are driven by a strong focus on statistical computing and its application to biomedicine. I’m particularly interested in the meta-analysis of both homogeneous and heterogeneous signals, pathway-guided disease subtyping, statistical computing, and multi-omics data integration. In addition to my methodological research, I am currently collaborating with the Lee-Oesterreich lab to explore the molecular mechanisms behind breast cancer development and therapy resistance, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for breast cancer patients!
